# 🛠️ Task 1: Downtime Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

## 🎯 Objective

Analyze telemetry data from four Daikibo factories to answer:
- Which factory experienced the most machine breakdowns?
- Which machines were most frequently responsible?

## 🧾 Data Description

- **File**: `telemetry_data.json`
- **Source**: JSON file containing machine telemetry data recorded every 10 minutes for May 2021 across:
  - Meiyo (Tokyo)
  - Seiko (Osaka)
  - Berlin (Germany)
  - Shenzhen (China)

Each location has 9 types of machines, and the goal is to identify machine and location-specific performance issues.

## 📊 Tools Used

- Tableau (for dashboard creation and visualization)
- Excel (preliminary data formatting and exploration)

## 📈 Deliverables

- **`Downtime_Dashboard.twbx`**: Interactive dashboard showing:
  - Factory-wise and machine-wise breakdown counts
  - Visual summary of performance

## 📍 Outcome

The dashboard effectively highlights the location with the highest machine failures and pinpoints the worst-performing machines, providing actionable insights for operations improvement.
