💼Deloitte Australia Job Simulation – Data Analyst Role
This project was completed as part of the Forage Deloitte Australia Virtual Job Simulation. It simulates real-world tasks a data analyst might be expected to perform at Deloitte, including data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and insight generation.

📌 Project Overview
The simulation was split into two tasks:

🔧 Task 1: Downtime Analysis with Telemetry Data (Tableau + JSON)
Objective: Identify the factory with the most frequent machine breakdowns and determine which machines failed most often.

Dataset: JSON file with telemetry data from 4 global factories (May 2021).

Tools Used: Tableau, Excel

Key Deliverables:

A Tableau dashboard summarizing downtime by factory and machine type.

Insights into performance issues by location.

📁 Files:

Task_1_Downtime_Analysis/telemetry_data.json

Task_1_Downtime_Analysis/Downtime_Dashboard.twbx (Tableau Workbook)

Task_1_Downtime_Analysis/README.md (Task-level documentation)

🧮 Task 2: Gender Pay Equality Analysis (Excel)
Objective: Analyze salary equality across factories and job roles.

Dataset: Excel file with Equality Score (from -100 to +100).

Task: Create a new column to classify the equality level into:

Fair (between -10 and +10)

Unfair (between -20 and -10 OR 10 and 20)

Highly Discriminative (< -20 or > 20)

Tools Used: Microsoft Excel
